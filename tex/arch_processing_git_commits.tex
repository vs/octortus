\subsection{Processing Git Commits}

No special actions are taken on Git commits. This helps to make sure that Git workflow is not interrupted and not slowed down by
the mere presence of the Translator.
\\\\
All necessary translation of Git repository to Subversion one might be performed on demand, at the time there is real user's request
to Subversion server, or in advance in case user have scheduled such translation or agreed on some overhead connected to Translator
working with user's repository.
