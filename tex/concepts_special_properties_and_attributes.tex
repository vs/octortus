\subsubsection{Symbolic Links}
Git stores symbolic link as an entry at Tree Object with a special file mode and corresponding blob containing "path/to/target".
\\\\
Subversion represents symbolic link as a file with content "link path/to/target" and a property svn:special set on it.
\\\\
So translation is performed by adding or removing "link " prefix to the file content and setting the mode or the property.
\\\\
If file at Subversion repository has svn:special property but its content doesn't start with "link " prefix, it is considered as an ordinary file and translated as a blob.
