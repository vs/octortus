\subsection{Not Translated Concepts}
This version of Translator specification does not cover translation of the following concepts:
\begin{itemize}
\item Subversion svn:keywords special property
\item Regular Subversion properties and Git attributes
\item Subversion revision properties and Git notes
\item Subversion path based authentication
\end{itemize}

First version of Translator ignores above mentioned entities on translation and will do no attempt to translate them.
