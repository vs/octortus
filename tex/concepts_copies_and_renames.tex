\subsection{Copies and Renames}
This section decribes translation of files and directories copies and renames, \emph{other than} copies and renames of 
branches (/branches/\emph{B}) and tags (/tags/\emph{T}). For that sort of copies and renames refer to the "Branches and Tags" 
section of this specification.\\\\
Rename translation does not differ from translation of the copy, because both Git and Subversion
express renames as a composition of copy and deletion. 

\subsubsection{Copies in Subversion to Git}
No special translation is performed for a file or directory copied or renamed in Subversion revision. Copy of the single file is translated 
to creation of a new file in the corresponding Git commit. Copy of a directory is translated to creation of a new directory with all its children
in the corresponding Git commit.

\subsubsection{Copies in Git to Subversion}
Whenever it is revealed that new file in Git commit is a result of copy or rename, this new file creation is translated to a file copy in the 
corresponding Subversion revision.\\\\ 
When amount of copied files in a new directory exceeds certain treshold (percentage of the amount of files in the original directory), then new directory
creation is translated into a directory copy with appropriate directory content adjustment in the correspoding Subversion revision.
