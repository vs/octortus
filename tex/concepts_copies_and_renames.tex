\subsection{Copies and Renames}
This section describes translation of files and directories copies and renames, \emph{other than} copies and renames of 
branches (/branches/\emph{B}) and tags (/tags/\emph{T}). For that sort of copies and renames refer to the "Branches and Tags" 
section of this specification.\\\\

\subsubsection{Copies in Subversion to Git}
No special translation is performed for a file or directory copied or renamed in Subversion revision. Copy of the single file is translated 
to creation of a new file in the corresponding Git commit. Copy of a directory is translated to creation of a new directory with all its children
in the corresponding Git commit.

\subsubsection{Copies in Git to Subversion}
Git provides means to detect rename of a file in a Git commit, but does not support copy detection, which could be 
a very expensive operation. For that reason, only file renames are treated in a special way by the Translator and
no attempt is made to detect file copies. Translator uses simple metric to detect directory rename.\\\\
Whenever it is revealed that new file in Git commit is a result of rename, this new file creation is translated to a file copy and deletion in the 
corresponding Subversion revision.\\\\ 
Directory is considered to be renamed in Git commit, when original directory no longer exists and newly added directory contains
files detected as being moved from the original directory. When detected, directory rename is translated into a directory copy
and deletion with appropriate changes to the new directory contents.
