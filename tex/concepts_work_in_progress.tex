\subsection{Work in Progress}

\subsubsection{Merge Translation and Shelf Linearization}

A common Git use case are modifications performed by multiple users in their local branches and then merged all together into the main development branch of the remote repository. 
For this scenario every user's branch becomes a shelf (see "Shelf Branches" section). Subversion users are not accustomed to
to this kind of workflow and would prefer to see linear history of changes on the main branch, where each revision have been committed by a particular user.
\\\\
As an experimental feature for that use case, we introduce a shelf linearization approach shown at the diagram \ref{boat_merge_keep_history_linear_git_to_svn}.
\begin{center}

\label{boat_merge_keep_history_linear_git_to_svn}%
\end{center}

If commit \emph{c} and a pair of commits \emph{d} and \emph{c} affects independent sets of files, 
then it is possible to imitate linear history for branch \emph{branch1}. 
For that purpose Translator creates three revisions r6, r7, r8 instead of a single revision that would be mapped to merge commit \emph{f}.
\\\\
For every commit at shelf Translator generates a revision with synthetic cherry-pick merge of the revision mapped to this commit. Finally revision r8 is the revision corresponding to commit \emph{f} and also it has the history of the shelf within svn:mergeinfo property. Hence mapping commit \emph{f} to revision r8 is valid. Having these revisions at branch branch1 Subversion users see history of branch branch1 linear.
\\\\
Shelf linearization has a few drawbacks:
\begin{enumerate}
\compactlist
	\item Main branch and shelf must not modify the same file, otherwise the approach is not applicable.
	\item At revisions r7 and r8 there could appear build failures since at this revision branch1 state is generated by Translator with no additional checks.
	\item This approach violates commits to revision mapping, since \emph{f} commit should be mapped to a sequence of revision r6, r7 and r8 instead of one single revision. It needs an extension of suggested commit to revision mapping.
\end{enumerate}

Shelf linearization could be applied to any branch to keep history linear, but \emph{shelf} branch is the most common target
for the linearization approach.

\subsubsection{Git Forks}
Git Fork is an unique feature of GitHub. First version of Translator translates Git Fork and pull request using Subversion concepts of copy and merge,
but makes not attempt to represent Subversion operations as a Git Fork.\\\\
Further versions of Translator might extend translation
rules so that some specific copies and merges performed in Subversion repository are translated into Git Fork.

\subsubsection{Forked Repository}
Git Repository Fork creates new Git repository on GitHub. This new forked Git repository has the following 
important features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Repository is assigned to a particular \emph{user}
\item Repository holds information on its \emph{origin} and includes complete origin history
\item Changes made in the forked repository might be \emph{pulled back} into origin repository
\end{itemize}

These features make its natural to translate Git Fork into a copy \emph{within} Subversion repository. Single fork 
operation is translated into a revision which copies Subversion repository top-level directories into another top-level directory. 
Thus, fork performed by the \emph{user} will be translated into the following revision:\\

rN user\\ 
=======================\\
Fork comment             \\
=======================\\
A /\emph{user}/trunk copied from /trunk at rM\\
A /\emph{user}/branches copied from /branches at rM\\
A /\emph{user}/tags copied from /tags at rM\\\\

Repository layout after the fork:\\

/trunk\\
/branches\\
/tags\\
/\emph{user}/trunk\\
/\emph{user}/branches\\
/\emph{user}/tags\\\\

Certain limitations are enforces on the fork /\emph{user} directory - similar to the other top-level directories it might not be 
copied or deleted. Subdirectories of /\emph{user} directory are subjects to the same limitations that are described in the "Fixed Repository Layout" section
and additionally subdirectories of /\emph{user} directory might not be copied to the locations outside of the /\emph{user} directory.
\\\\
Changes made by Subversion users to the files and directories in /\emph{user} directory are translated to the Git commits in the forked Git
repository and vice versa - Git commits in the forked Git repository are translated into Subversion revisions which modifies files
and directories in the corresponding /\emph{user} directory of Subversion repository.

\subsubsection{Pull Request}

Accepted Git pull request is represented as a Git commit(s) in the original Git repository. Those Git commits are translated into Subversion
revision using standard translation rules. Additionally, Translator updates merge tracking information on the affected branches, so that
from the Subversion user perspective, translated revision looks like a merge of changes from the corresponding branches in the /\emph{user} directory. 
Merge tracking information in Subversion repository after translation may look like:\\

/trunk : from /\emph{user}/trunk:10-11\\
/branches/b : from /\emph{user}/branches/b:10-11\\

assuming that revisions 10 and 11 represent changes in the forked Git repository.

\subsection{Not (yet) Translated Concepts}
This version of Translator specification does not cover translation of the following concepts:
\begin{itemize}
\item Subversion svn:keywords special property
\item Regular Subversion properties and Git attributes
\item Subversion revision properties and Git notes
\item Subversion path based authentication
\end{itemize}

First version of Translator ignores above mentioned entities on translation and will do no attempt to translate them.
