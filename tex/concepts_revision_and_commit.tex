\subsection{Revisions and Commits}

Both revision in subversion and commit in git are atomic changes fixed at certain moment in time by certain person with certain message. This metadata of change is always translated as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\compactlist
\item Time
\item Author
\item Commit message
\end{enumerate}
